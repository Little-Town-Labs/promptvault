## ✅ Why Vercel Wins for Your Project

### 1. **You're Already Using Vercel Packages:**

These won't work on Netlify!

- Zero configuration needed
- Automatic optimization
- Server Components just work

### 3. **Prisma + PostgreSQL:**
- Vercel handles connection pooling
- Edge runtime compatible
- No timeout issues
- Better cold start performance

### 4. **Free Tier is Better:**
- More build minutes (6,000 vs 300)
- Unlimited team members
- Better function limits
- Free analytics

### 5. **Developer Experience:**
- Better logs and debugging
- Real-time error tracking
- Preview comments
- GitHub integration is smoother

## ⚠️ When to Consider Netlify

**Netlify is better for:**

1. **Simple Static Sites:**
   - Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby
   - No API routes
   - No database connections

2. **JAMstack Projects:**
   - Pre-rendered at build time
   - Minimal server-side logic
   - CMS-based sites

3. **Netlify-Specific Features:**
   - Netlify Forms
   - Netlify Identity
   - Netlify CMS
   - Split testing

4. **Your Case?**
   - ❌ You have dynamic API routes
   - ❌ You use database connections
   - ❌ You need server-side rendering
   - ❌ You're using Vercel packages

**Verdict:** Netlify is NOT ideal for your project.

- ✅ Using Next.js (YOU ARE)
- ✅ Need API routes (YOU DO)
- ✅ Using database (YOU DO - Prisma)
- ✅ Want best performance (WHO DOESN'T)
- ✅ Already using Vercel packages (YOU ARE)
- ✅ Need good free tier (YOU DO)

### Choose Netlify if:
- ❌ Simple static site (NOT YOUR CASE)
- ❌ Using Netlify-specific features (NOT YOUR CASE)
- ❌ No database connections (NOT YOUR CASE)
- ❌ Prefer Netlify UI (MINOR PREFERENCE)
