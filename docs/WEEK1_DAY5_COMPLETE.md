## 🎓 What You Learned

### Layout Patterns:
- ✅ Sticky navbar implementation
- ✅ Sidebar with active state
- ✅ Responsive layout with flex
- ✅ Route groups in Next.js `(dashboard)`
- ✅ Nested layouts

### Next.js App Router:

- ✅ Client components (`'use client'`)
- ✅ `usePathname` for active routes

### Clerk Integration:

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Navbar not showing?
- Check you're visiting `/dashboard` (not just `/`)
- Dashboard layout applies only to dashboard routes

### Sidebar not visible?
- It's hidden on mobile (< lg breakpoint)
- Resize browser to > 1024px width

### Navigation not working?
- Check href paths match route structure
- Verify files are in `(dashboard)` folder

### TypeScript errors?
- Run `pnpm db:generate` to regenerate Prisma types
- Restart TypeScript server in editor
