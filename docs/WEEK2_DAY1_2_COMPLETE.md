## 🧪 Testing the System

### Prerequisites

**Database Required**: The system needs a PostgreSQL database to work.

You have two options:

#### Option 1: Use Neon (Recommended - Free Tier)
1. Go to https://neon.tech
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy the connection string
5. Update `.env` file:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/promptvault?sslmode=require"
   ```

#### Option 2: Local PostgreSQL
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL (if not installed)
# Update .env with local connection:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/promptvault"
```

### Step 1: Set Up Database

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
pnpm db:generate

# Push schema to database (creates tables)
pnpm db:push

# OR run migrations (production approach)
pnpm db:migrate
```

### Step 2: Start Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Flow

1. **Visit Landing Page**: http://localhost:3000
   - Should see modern landing page
   - Click "Get Started" to sign up
   - OR click "Sign In" if you have account

2. **Create First Prompt**: http://localhost:3000/prompts/new
   - Fill in title: "Blog Post Generator"
   - Add description: "Generates blog posts on any topic"
   - Add content: "Write a {length} blog post about {topic} in a {tone} tone"
   - Add variables: "topic, length, tone"
   - Add tags: "marketing, content, blog"
   - Click "Create Prompt"

3. **View Prompts List**: http://localhost:3000/prompts
   - Should see your new prompt in a card
   - See all metadata (versions, comments, favorites)
   - See tags and category
   - Try clicking "Edit" button
   - Try clicking "Delete" button (confirm dialog appears)

4. **Search Prompts**:
   - Use search box at top
   - Search for "blog" - should find your prompt
   - Clear search to see all again

5. **Delete Prompt**:
   - Click "Delete" button
   - Confirm in dialog
